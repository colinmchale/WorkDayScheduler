# Work Day Scheduler

## How It Works

This calendar application has the ability to store your information about your daily work scheudle. The box in the middle of the page is made to type in your activites throughout the day and then by clicking the "_Save_" button on the right-hand side, your information will never go away! The items are saved in the site's local storage.

The schedule will also be updated constantly to display the curent hour of the day. Past hours will de displayed in Grey, the current hour will be displayed in Green, and the hours to come will be Red. The current date is also available at the top under the header.
